Herugostuo has been worked on since 2021 or early 2022, this is the source code, most game mechanics were explored in V1
but the best version and current version before the GODOT switch is V2, it has the best and most readable code, but V1 will
have around the same code as well but way less organized and more mechanics.
Most of the code like 60% is mine, but 40% is very like frankensteined around and thats why alot of the codem ight be spaghettied
and very unorganized and not written well or consistently.
Use this as  a ref to build the Godot prototype and mechanics.
